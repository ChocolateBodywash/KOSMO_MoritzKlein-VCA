This was my first dip into PCB design and oh boy, it would have made more sense to start with the simpler ADSR. There were a lot of things I could have done more efficiently and possibly better (adding normalization between VCAs) but it works.

Note: This was created by a hobbyist with no formal engineering training outside various late night YouTube binges. 
I’ve confirmed these designs to work but I make no guarantees on the design working efficiently.. or working at all.
